      <h4>UPGRADES</h4>
      <p>Often times all you need is an upgrade or a good tune up rather than a new computer.  The sales people will never tell you that but often it is the truth.  It is worth having someone take a look at your computer before you replace it.  AS a rule of thumb; after 5 years, you would probably be better off replacing.  Otherwise, it dependes on your system.</p>

    <h4>Free Alternatives to MS Office</h4>
      <p>There are many free software &nbsp;packages online that will accomplish the same thing as the pricey ones. &nbsp;There is more than one software package that can accomplish everything Microsoft Office can do and they are free. &nbsp;Don't go out and spend money on software because you think you have no choice. I can show you how to find alternatives and which sites are safe and unsafe to download software.  Please check out my training documentation section for additional information.</p>

      <h4>ADVICE</h4>
      <p>One of the most dangerous things that can happen to you via your computer is identity theft.  If you have children, it is vital that you know how to protect them.  The internet has become an open window into your kid's lives.  A little bit of training can literally be the difference between life and death.</p>
